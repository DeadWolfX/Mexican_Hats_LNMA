Here, you can find the implementation of Mexican Hats. 
There are two directories: Mexican_Hats_jupyter_lab and Mexican_Hats_command_line. 
Both of them perform the same implementation of Mexican Hats. 
The difference between the two is that Mexican_Hats_jupyter_lab carries out the main implementation using Jupyter Lab, 
while Mexican_Hats_command_line takes its parameters from the command line and verifies whether the necessary packages are correctly installed. 
If they are not installed, it will perform the necessary installations.
