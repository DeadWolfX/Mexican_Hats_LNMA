<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Here, you can find the python implementation of Mexican Hats.<br>
There are two directories: <b>Mexican_Hats_jupyter_lab</b> and <b>Mexican_Hats_command_line.</b><br>
Both of them perform the same implementation of Mexican Hats. <br>
The difference between the two is that Mexican_Hats_jupyter_lab carries out the main implementation using Jupyter Lab, 
while Mexican_Hats_command_line takes its parameters from the command line and verifies whether the necessary packages are correctly installed. 
If they are not installed, it will perform the necessary installations.</p>

<p>This project is based on the master's thesis work of Raul Pinto Camara, which follows the ideas from the article <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34693-9">Extending resolution within a single imaging frame
</a> where the shifted mean operator is replaced by various second derivative operators (Laplacian,Difference of Gaussians[DoG],Hessian and  Mean Shift) to improve image resolution.</p>
